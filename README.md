    ipole is a program that solves the equations of polarized radiative transfer
    in covariant form, using ray tracing.   It produces images in Stokes I,Q,U,V
    at the location of a "camera."   
    
    This version is configured to use data from a harm3d run, which use modified
    Kerr-Schild coordinates, and assumes synchrotron emission and absorption
    along with faraday rotation.
